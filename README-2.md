# HLS-based-Signal-Classification-Using-Hybrid-CNN

In the non-cooperative channel communication scenario, there
comes a need to recognize and classify the modulation format of the
received signals to identify the communication targets and to have
better management over them. To solve problems such as high
complexity, low accuracy and hard process of manual extraction of
signal features we can go for a Deep Neural Network based modulation
format identification block so that we can effectively classify received
signals and apply specific demodulation technique to it. The proposed
project will implement such a Neural Network to advanced 4G and 5G
modulated signals and implement it on an FPGA board using High
Level Synthesis for Machine Learning (hls4ml) concept.

In the ever-evolving landscape of wireless communication, the need for
robust and adaptive systems capable of accurately classifying modulated signals is
paramount. The Signal Classification System proposed in this thesis represents a
significant leap forward in artificial intelligence, leveraging deep neural networks to
classify received signals based on their modulation techniques. With a focus on HighLevel Synthesis (HLS), this system is designed to provide real-time, intelligent signal
classification that extends beyond conventional approaches.
The primary objective of this project is to develop a Neural Network-based Artificial
Intelligence system adept at discerning the modulation techniques employed during
signal transmission. This capability holds immense importance, especially in
scenarios where signals are subject to noise, interference, or other distortions. The
proposed system aims to not only classify signals accurately but also to facilitate the
application of appropriate demodulation techniques, thereby enhancing the
processing of digital signals even in challenging communication environments.
